LAM15M Documentation
====================

Lam15m is a MATLAB R2021b live script that calculates the stresses and strains of a unit-width composite plate under in-plane and/or out-of-plane mechanical loading, thermal loading and hygro loading based on the laminate analysis program originally written in BASIC by Dr Ian Farrow. The purpose of the script is to help to understand and learning within the University of Bristol Composites Design and Manufacturing (CDM) unit. A key piece of work within the unit is the design and sizing of a composite part designated by the 'customer' (*i.e.* the unit director). The MATLAB script is to be used as a part of the calculations for the CDM unit.

The complete GATORcell code can be found here `LAM15M GitHub page <https://github.com/aq18507/LAM15M>`_. During the development phase it will only be accessible for students and staff at the University of Bristol.

.. note::
   This site is still a work in progress. Hence why there will be some errors within the code, some components of the scripts and the documentation are inclomplete. Please report any issues here `LAM15Mdocs GitHub Issues page <https://github.com/aq18507/LAM15M/issues>`_.
