LAM15M Documentation
====================

Lam15m is a MATLAB R2021b live script that calculates the stresses and strains of a unit-width composite plate under in-plane and/or out-of-plane mechanical loading, thermal loading and hygro loading. The purpose of the script is to help understanding and learning within the University of Bristol Composites Design and Manufacturing (CDM) unit. A key piece of work within the unit is the design and sizing of a composite part designated by the `customer' (\textit{i.e.}~the unit director). The \verb+MATLAB+ script is to be used as a part of the calculations for the CDM unit.




.. Welcome to the GATORcell documentation. This website is here to aid you through the GATORcell Matlab wrapper. This essentially consists of a series of scripts designed to create ABAQUS input files for GATOR panels, using GMSH as a 3D CAD design and meshing algorithm.

.. The complete GATORcell code can be found here `GATORcell GitHub page <https://github.com/aq18507/GATORcell>`_. This code relies on three software packages to run. `ABAQUS/Standard <https://www.3ds.com/products-services/simulia/products/abaqus/abaqusstandard/>`_ as an FEA solver ideally with the capability of having access to ABAQUS/CAE for debugging. `GMSH <https://gmsh.info/>`_ as a meshing and command line CAD tool and finally `Matlab <https://uk.mathworks.com/>`_ to run this GATORcell scripts in. Refer to the :ref:`Compatibility` page for the tested software versions.

.. .. note::
..    This site is still a work in progress. Hence why there will be some errors, some areas which are inclomplete and a large number of typos. If you think that some of the documentation is wrong log this here `GATORdocs GitHub Issues page <https://github.com/aq18507/GATORdocumentation/issues>`_.
