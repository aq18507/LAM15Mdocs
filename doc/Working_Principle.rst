The basic premise of the script is that the student will inputs variables that the script takes and calculates stresses and strains from. There are two possible ways of inputting data: 1) **MATLAB** and 2) **Excel**

    Please note that the **Excel** functionality is not actively developed and for that reason, it must be used with caution.
