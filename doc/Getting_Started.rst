Getting Started
###############

This page explains how to get started with LAM15M.

Minimum requirements
++++++++++++++++++++

#. ``MATLAB``: A version of MATLAB must be installed that supports live scripts. It was written in version ``R2021b`` implying that it is likely compatible with future versions.
#. ``Microsoft Excel``: Microsoft Excel or an equivalent program which allows ``.xlsx`` files to be edited must be installed the Excel import/export functionality within LAM15M is selected.
#. ``Windows``: LAM15M is written to run on a PC running Windows 10.
#. ``MacOS``: LAM15M is programmed such that it will also run on MacOS.

LAM15M was not tested on any ``Linux`` distro. That said, the only difference between the Mac and PC version is the assignment of the paths which are used to index the scripts which are different on a PC and Mac. This means it is likely that the inclusion of ``linux`` as an operating system will suffice using the same settings as for MacOS since they are both UNIX based operating systems.

OCTAVE is sometimes used instead of MATLAB. This was never tested on a version of OCTAVE, but input is greatly appreciated making this available to a wider audience.

Useful additional software
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

#. ``GitHub``: Since this is still in active development it is useful to utilise **GitHub** to pull the current and most up-to-date version as new modules might be added, performance increased and errors eliminated.
